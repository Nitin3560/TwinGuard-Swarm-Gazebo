# TwinGuard-Swarm-Gazebo

**Digital Twin-Assisted Resilient UAV Swarm Autonomy with ROS 2, Gazebo, and PX4 SITL**

TwinGuard-Swarm-Gazebo is a simulation and autonomy framework for evaluating resilient UAV swarm coordination under sensor degradation and adversarial attacks. The system combines PX4 software-in-the-loop flight dynamics, Gazebo-based simulation, ROS 2 middleware, digital-twin state prediction, trust-aware integrity monitoring, and formation-level supervisory control.

The project is designed to support repeatable experiments where a UAV swarm performs a coordinated mission while one or more agents experience GPS spoofing, communication degradation, delayed state replay, or sensing faults. TwinGuard estimates per-agent integrity, reduces authority for compromised agents, and reconfigures the formation to preserve mission-level performance.

## Key Capabilities

- PX4 SITL multicopter simulation in Gazebo
- ROS 2 integration for state, command, diagnostics, and logging
- C++ integrity scoring and trust-management core
- Multi-UAV formation supervision
- Per-agent digital twin prediction
- Residual and normalized-innovation-based anomaly scoring
- Stateful trust management and authority scaling
- GPS spoofing, communication dropout, and replay-attack scenarios
- Experiment logging for RMSE, recovery time, trust, residuals, and mission success
- Command-center replay generated from experiment logs
- Real dataset replay into live PX4/Gazebo odometry for video-recordable validation

## Target Experiment

The reference experiment uses a multi-UAV formation mission:

1. Spawn a PX4/Gazebo multicopter swarm.
2. Fly a nominal formation trajectory.
3. Inject GPS spoofing or communication degradation into a selected UAV.
4. Predict expected state using a per-agent digital twin.
5. Compute residuals and trust scores.
6. Reduce authority of the compromised UAV.
7. Reconfigure the formation.
8. Report tracking RMSE, detection time, recovery time, and mission success.

## ROS 2 Integration

Implemented and planned nodes/packages:

- `twinguard_swarm_integrity_cpp`: C++ package for digital-twin integrity scoring, trust, fault labels, and authority scaling.
- `integrity_node_cpp`: C++ ROS 2 node that subscribes to PX4 `VehicleOdometry`, predicts expected state, and publishes residual/trust diagnostics.
- `formation_supervisor_node`: C++ ROS 2 node that subscribes to TwinGuard trust/diagnostics and PX4 odometry, generates static-hold or circular mission setpoints, then publishes trust-gated `OffboardControlMode`, `TrajectorySetpoint`, and `VehicleCommand` messages.
- `dataset_replay_node`: Python ROS 2 bridge that applies a real dataset degradation profile to live PX4 odometry for validation and recording.
- `digital_twin_node`: predicts per-UAV expected state.
- `attack_injector`: injects reproducible sensor/communication faults.
- `experiment_logger`: records CSV and rosbag2 outputs.

The ROS 2 package skeleton is located under [ros2_ws/src](ros2_ws/src). The latency-sensitive integrity/scoring and trust-gated offboard-supervision paths are implemented in C++; Python is reserved for launch-time orchestration, experiment tooling, dataset replay, and mission-control prototyping.
A single trust-gated supervisor (`formation_supervisor_node`) handles both static-hold and circular-mission modes, validated against both live PX4 SITL odometry and real-dataset-replay-perturbed odometry.

## Single-UAV PX4 Validation Run

The current live validation path runs one PX4 `gz_x500` vehicle, replays a real failure/degradation dataset into the odometry stream, scores the perturbed state with the C++ TwinGuard integrity node, and flies a repeatable offboard mission in Gazebo.

Terminal 1:

```bash
cd ~/PX4-Autopilot
make px4_sitl gz_x500
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd ~/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent/build
MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
```

Terminal 3:

```bash
cd ~/px4_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch twinguard_swarm_bringup twinguard_single_uav_replay_mission.launch.py \
  dataset_csv:=/home/nitin/scenario23_seq20_real_channel_timeseries.csv \
  error_scale:=0.1 \
  max_offset_m:=3.0 \
  mission_radius_m:=3.0 \
  takeoff_altitude_m:=2.0
```

The real dataset is used as a replayed degradation profile for sensor/integrity validation. It does not replace the PX4 flight controller or directly define the UAV path. The C++ `formation_supervisor_node` owns both the circular mission trajectory and the integrity-aware command response.

## Three-UAV Formation Validation Run

The next validation target is a lightweight swarm run with three PX4 `x500` vehicles:

```text
Drone 0: nominal leader-style mission controller
Drone 1: nominal formation follower
Drone 2: dataset-degraded UAV with TwinGuard replay/integrity scoring
```

The formation uses three synchronized C++ formation supervisors with fixed spatial offsets. Drone 2 receives the real dataset replay on its integrity path so the video shows a visible swarm mission while the diagnostics show degradation, residual growth, and trust response for the affected vehicle.

Start a three-vehicle PX4/Gazebo run using the multi-vehicle launch method supported by your PX4 checkout. Then confirm the generated ROS 2 odometry topics:

```bash
ros2 topic list | grep vehicle_odometry
```

The default launch arguments expect the common PX4 ROS 2 topic layout:

```text
/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry
/px4_1/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry
/px4_2/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry
```

Launch the TwinGuard formation mission:

```bash
cd ~/px4_ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch twinguard_swarm_bringup twinguard_three_uav_replay_mission.launch.py \
  dataset_csv:=/home/nitin/scenario23_seq20_real_channel_timeseries.csv
```

If your PX4 topics use different prefixes, override them explicitly:

```bash
ros2 launch twinguard_swarm_bringup twinguard_three_uav_replay_mission.launch.py \
  dataset_csv:=/home/nitin/scenario23_seq20_real_channel_timeseries.csv \
  drone_0_px4_prefix:="" \
  drone_1_px4_prefix:=px4_1 \
  drone_2_px4_prefix:=px4_2 \
  drone_0_odometry:=/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry \
  drone_1_odometry:=/px4_1/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry \
  drone_2_odometry:=/px4_2/fmu/out/vehicle_odometry
```

## Implementation Status

This repository defines the ROS 2 package structure, autonomy-layer interfaces, topic contract, setup plan, C++ integrity-scoring package, C++ trust-gated formation supervisor, and real dataset replay bridge. The current Phase 1 path closes the loop from PX4 odometry to C++ trust scoring to C++ offboard command publication: nominal trust passes the mission setpoint through, degraded trust scales authority, and suspected attack holds current position. The C++ supervisor also owns the repeatable circular mission used by the single- and three-UAV validation launches. The next engineering milestone is to extend this into explicit planner-assurance logic.

## Intended Outcome

The intended final artifact is a reproducible UAV swarm simulation pipeline where dashboard values, metrics, and command-center videos are generated from PX4/Gazebo/ROS 2 experiment logs.
